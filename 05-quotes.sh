# Shell Supports two quotes
# ' - single quote
# " - Double quote

# When to use quotes
# if our input to any command is having a special characters ( not a-z, not 0-9, not _ ), then to nullify those speciality we use quotes

echo *
echo "*"

# double quotes are liberal quoting( less strict quoting)
